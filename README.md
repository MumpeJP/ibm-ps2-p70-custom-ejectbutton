## Printing

The parts were printed on a **Bambu Lab A1 mini** with a **0.4 mm nozzel**. For best results with a layer height of **0.08 mm** (A layer height of 0.2 mm should also work).

(Dedicated .3mf file: <a href="model\IBM FLOPPY EDJECT BUTTON v2.3mf">Here</a>).

But a Bambu Lab printer is not necessary. Any other printer should do it.
