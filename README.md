# IBM ps/2 p70 Custom Eject Button
Custom eject button for the **TEAC FD-235HF** floppy drive that fits into the IBM ps/2 P70 (Type 8573) floppy drive case.

[!NOTE]
The compatibility to similar models and types haven't been tested! Adjustments for different floppy drive cases may be needed.

## Printing
<img style="float:right;" src="img\comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison: 'old' eject button - custom eject button" height=170px width=auto></img>
The parts were printed on a **Bambu Lab A1 mini** with a **0.4 mm nozzel**. For best results with a layer height of **0.08 mm** (A layer height of 0.2 mm should also work).

(Dedicated .3mf file: [Here](model\IBM FLOPPY EDJECT BUTTON v2.3mf)).

But a Bambu Lab printer is not necessary. Any other printer should do it.
